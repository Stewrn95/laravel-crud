CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the basic operations typically performed on data in a database or storage system. In the context of a web application, CRUD operations are often associated with interacting with resources such as users, products, or articles. To get started with this Laravel CRUD project:
Download all the files and ensure they are placed in one main folder.
If you are using Visual Studio Code IDE, simply move the folder containing all the files to the application to open them.
Navigate to resources/views/products/index.blade.php.
In the terminal, ensure you are in the correct directory. If not, use the cd command and paste the path to the project files.
To run the server, type php artisan serve in the terminal.
Make sure to start Apache and MySQL options in the XAMPP control panel. So, just type localhost to open the myphpadmin.
Please follow the step instructions in the SQL file to run the queries.
